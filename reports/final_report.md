# Recommender System Report

## Introduction
Recommender systems play a crucial role in enhancing user experience by suggesting items based on their preferences and behavior. In this report, we present the development and evaluation of a movie recommender system using collaborative filtering.

## Data Analysis
The dataset used for building the recommender system consists of user information, movie details, and user ratings. We performed the following data analysis steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Loaded user data, movie data, and user ratings from separate files.
2. **Data Exploration**: Explored the distribution of ratings, user demographics, and movie details.
3. **Data Preparation**: Merged the datasets and created a Surprise Dataset for collaborative filtering.

## Model Implementation
We implemented a collaborative filtering recommender system using the Surprise library. The KNNBasic algorithm with cosine similarity was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in capturing user-item interactions.

## Model Advantages and Disadvantages
### Advantages
- **Personalization**: The model provides personalized recommendations based on user preferences.
- **Scalability**: Collaborative filtering is scalable and can handle large datasets.
- **No Need for Feature Engineering**: Collaborative filtering does not require explicit feature engineering.

### Disadvantages
- **Cold Start Problem**: The model struggles with new users or items with limited interaction history.
- **Sparsity**: The user-item interaction matrix can be highly sparse, affecting the model's accuracy.
- **Lack of Interpretability**: Collaborative filtering models lack transparency in explaining recommendations.

## Training Process
The training process involved loading the data, creating a Surprise Dataset, splitting it into training and test sets, and training the KNNBasic collaborative filtering model. The training parameters were set to default values for simplicity.

## Evaluation
We evaluated the model using both the training set and a separate test set (`u1_test`). The evaluation metrics included Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Results
The model achieved the following results:

- **Training Set RMSE**: [Training RMSE]
- **Training Set MAE**: [Training MAE]

- **Test Set RMSE**: [Test RMSE]
- **Test Set MAE**: [Test MAE]

These metrics provide insights into the model's performance, with lower values indicating better accuracy. Further optimizations and experimentation with different algorithms can be explored to improve the recommender system's effectiveness.
